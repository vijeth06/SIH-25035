This new policy is fantastic and will really help our community move forward.
I'm concerned about the implementation timeline - seems too rushed.
The government should consider public opinion more carefully before making such decisions.
Excellent work on drafting this legislation - very comprehensive and well thought out.
This bill will negatively impact small businesses in our region.
I support the general direction but have reservations about specific clauses.
More transparency is needed in the decision-making process.
This is exactly what our country needs right now - progressive and forward-thinking.
The proposed changes don't go far enough to address the core issues.
I appreciate the effort but think alternative approaches might be more effective.
