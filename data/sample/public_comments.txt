This regulation represents a significant step forward in protecting individual privacy rights in the digital age.

The comprehensive approach to data protection covers all major aspects from collection to processing and storage.

However, I have concerns about the implementation timeline and the burden it may place on smaller organizations.

The penalties outlined seem appropriate for ensuring compliance, but guidance on avoiding violations would be helpful.

I strongly support the privacy-by-design principles incorporated throughout the draft legislation.

The cross-border data transfer provisions need more clarity to avoid hampering international business operations.

Overall, this is a well-crafted piece of legislation that balances privacy protection with practical business needs.

The public consultation process demonstrates transparency and commitment to stakeholder engagement.

More specific technical standards would help organizations understand compliance requirements better.

I appreciate the government's proactive approach to addressing emerging privacy challenges in the digital economy.
